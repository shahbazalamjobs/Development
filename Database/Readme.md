## 🧩 1. **Database Fundamentals (must know)**

*(Foundational questions + simple coding tasks)*

* What is a **database**, **table**, **row**, **column**
* **Primary key**, **Foreign key**, **Unique key**
* **Data types** (INTEGER, SERIAL, VARCHAR, TEXT, BOOLEAN, DATE, JSONB)
* **NULL vs NOT NULL**
* **DEFAULT** values
* **Constraints**: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`

---

## ⚙️ 2. **SQL Basics (most asked in coding rounds)**

* CRUD operations: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
* Filtering: `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `ILIKE`
* Sorting: `ORDER BY`
* Limiting results: `LIMIT`, `OFFSET` (for pagination)
* Aliases: `AS` (column/table alias)
* `DISTINCT` and removing duplicates

---

## 🔗 3. **Joins (Top 3 most frequently asked area)**

*(Used heavily in real projects and interviews)*

* `INNER JOIN`
* `LEFT JOIN`
* `RIGHT JOIN`
* `FULL OUTER JOIN`
* Joining **multiple tables**
* Join on **foreign keys**
* Difference between **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN**

👉 Example interview question:

> Get all users with their total number of orders (even if they have none).

---

## 📊 4. **Aggregations & Grouping**

*(Always tested in SQL query questions)*

* Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
* `GROUP BY`
* `HAVING` (difference from `WHERE`)
* Combining joins + aggregates (most common in tasks)

👉 Example:

> Find total sales per user where total > 1000.

---

## 🧱 5. **Database Relationships**

*(Backend interviews often test data modeling)*

* One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
* Setting up **foreign keys**
* Cascade delete/update (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)
* Example schema: `users`, `posts`, `comments`, `orders`, etc.

👉 Common question:

> Design a DB schema for users and their posts/comments.

---

## ⚡ 6. **Indexes & Query Optimization (important after 1 year exp)**

* What is an **index** and why it improves query speed
* **B-tree** index (default)
* When indexes **don’t help** (e.g. small tables, low selectivity)
* `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` basics
* Avoiding `SELECT *`

👉 Typical question:

> How do you find why a query is slow and how to optimize it?

---

## 🧠 7. **Transactions & ACID**

*(Every backend dev must understand this conceptually)*

* What are **Transactions**
* Commands: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
* **ACID properties**
* Example: order placement with multiple steps
* Concept of **rollback on failure**

👉 Interview question:

> Why use transactions in backend operations like payments?

---

## 💾 8. **Constraints & Data Integrity**

* `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`
* Foreign key constraint behavior
* Preventing bad data via constraints

---

## 🧩 9. **Subqueries & CTEs**

*(Common in mid-level SQL questions)*

* Subqueries in `WHERE` and `FROM`
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** using `WITH`
* Example:

  ```sql
  WITH total_orders AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY user_id
  )
  SELECT u.name, t.order_count
  FROM users u
  JOIN total_orders t ON u.id = t.user_id;
  ```

---

## 🔐 10. **Security & SQL Injection Prevention**

* Why **parameterized queries** are important
* Don’t use string concatenation in SQL
* Roles & privileges (basic understanding)

---

## 🧰 11. **JSON & JSONB (Frequently asked in modern projects)**

* Difference between `json` and `jsonb`
* Access operators: `->`, `->>`, `#>`
* Filtering JSON data using `@>`
* Use case: store metadata, user preferences, settings

👉 Example question:

> Query users where `settings->>'theme' = 'dark'`

---

## 🔄 12. **Database Design & Normalization**

* **1NF**, **2NF**, **3NF** (and why denormalization sometimes needed)
* Real-world schema design for simple app (users, orders, products)
* Importance of relationships + indexes

---

## 🚀 13. **Backend Integration Concepts**

* Using PostgreSQL with Node.js (`pg` or ORM like Prisma/Sequelize/Knex)
* **Connection pooling**
* **Environment variables** for DB connection (`.env`)
* Handling errors & async queries
* Using **transactions in code**

👉 Example:

> How do you handle DB connection failures in your Node backend?

---

## 🔍 Optional but Nice-to-Know (bonus for strong impression)

* **Views** and **Materialized Views**
* **Triggers** (basic awareness)
* **Stored Procedures / Functions** for reusable logic
* **Migrations** (with ORM tools)
* **Backup / Restore** (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`)
