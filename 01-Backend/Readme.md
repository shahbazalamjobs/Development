# 🧭 BACKEND MASTERY ROADMAP (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL Focus)

---

## 🩵 **Phase 1 — Core JavaScript Foundation (2–3 weeks)**

> Backend strength starts with deep JS understanding.

### 🎯 Topics:

* JS runtime vs browser
* Scope, closures, `this`
* Promises, async/await, callbacks
* Modules (`import` / `export`)
* Error handling (`try...catch`)
* JSON, destructuring, spread/rest operators

### 🧩 Practice:

* Write small async utilities (like delay(), retry())
* Build a CLI tool (e.g., “file organizer” using Node fs)
* Solve 10–20 async-based coding problems (LeetCode/Easy)

### 📘 Resources:

* “You Don’t Know JS Yet” by Kyle Simpson
* Frontend Masters “Deep JS Foundations” (optional)

---

## ⚙️ **Phase 2 — Node.js Fundamentals (3–4 weeks)**

### 🎯 Topics:

* How Node.js works (event loop, call stack, libuv)
* Global objects, process, environment variables
* File system (fs module) – read/write files
* Streams (readable/writable, piping)
* Buffers and performance optimization
* `path`, `os`, `crypto`, `cluster` modules
* npm, package.json, scripts, dependencies

### 🧩 Practice:

* CLI tool using Node fs + path
* Create a local logger using fs streams
* Environment-based config loader (dotenv)

### 💡 Interview Prep:

* Explain event loop phases
* Blocking vs non-blocking
* How Node handles concurrency

---

## 🚀 **Phase 3 — Express.js Mastery (4–6 weeks)**

### 🎯 Topics:

* Setting up server, routes, middleware
* Request/Response lifecycle
* Error handling and global error middleware
* CRUD operations
* Express Router for modular structure
* Validation with Joi or Zod
* Async middleware pattern (`express-async-handler`)
* CORS setup
* MVC pattern in Express

### 🧩 Practice Projects:

* CRUD API for users/posts
* File upload API (multer)
* Pagination + filtering API
* Rate limiter & custom error handler

### 💡 Interview Prep:

* Middleware flow
* Error handling structure
* REST design principles (idempotence, HTTP verbs)

---

## 🔒 **Phase 4 — Authentication & Authorization (3–4 weeks)**

### 🎯 Topics:

* JWT (sign, verify, refresh tokens)
* Password hashing (bcrypt)
* Cookie-based auth, sessions
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Secure routes and middleware
* OAuth basics (Google, GitHub)
* Common security middleware: Helmet, CORS

### 🧩 Projects:

* Auth API (register, login, logout)
* JWT refresh token flow
* Role-based user management API

### 💡 Interview Prep:

* Difference between session & token auth
* Refresh vs access token
* How to store tokens securely

---

## 🗄️ **Phase 5 — Database Integration (4–6 weeks)**

### 🎯 Topics:

* PostgreSQL basics: schema, joins, indexing
* SQL vs NoSQL overview
* Using **Prisma ORM** or **Sequelize**
* Migrations & seeding
* Transactions and relations
* Connection pooling
* Query optimization basics

### 🧩 Projects:

* Job Portal or Notes API with Postgres + Prisma
* Pagination + sorting + filtering
* Relationship APIs (one-to-many, many-to-many)

### 💡 Interview Prep:

* How joins work
* Difference between inner & outer join
* Transaction handling

---

## 🧰 **Phase 6 — Advanced Backend Engineering (6–8 weeks)**

### 🎯 Topics:

* Caching (Redis)
* Queues (BullMQ, RabbitMQ)
* File storage (AWS S3 / Cloudinary)
* WebSockets (Socket.io)
* Performance optimization
* Unit testing (Jest + Supertest)
* Logging (Winston, Morgan)
* Error monitoring (Sentry)

### 🧩 Projects:

* Real-time chat
* Task queue system
* Caching API responses

### 💡 Interview Prep:

* Scaling strategies
* Caching patterns (write-through, lazy)
* Difference between pub/sub and queues

---

## ☁️ **Phase 7 — Deployment & DevOps (3–4 weeks)**

### 🎯 Topics:

* Linux, SSH, process management (PM2)
* Dockerize your app
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
* Reverse proxy (Nginx)
* Environment setup (staging, production)
* Logging & monitoring in production

### 🧩 Practice:

* Deploy app on AWS EC2 / Render / Railway
* Docker + docker-compose setup
* Auto deploy with GitHub Actions

---

## 💼 **Phase 8 — System Design & Interview Preparation**

### 🎯 Topics:

* RESTful architecture
* Scaling backend (horizontal vs vertical)
* Load balancing, caching, sharding
* Database design for real systems
* Designing APIs for large systems (e.g. Instagram posts feed)
* Rate limiting, throttling, circuit breakers

### 🧩 Practice:

* Design APIs for e-commerce, chat app, booking app
* Draw ER diagrams for real projects

### 💡 Interview Focus:

* Explain architecture of your project
* How to scale your API
* Optimize slow queries or API response

---

## 🧠 **Phase 9 — Build & Polish Portfolio Projects**

Build at least 3 solid, interview-ready backend projects:

1. **Auth & Role-based API** (Express + JWT + Postgres)
2. **E-commerce or Job Portal API**
3. **Real-time app** (Socket.io + Redis + Queue)

Include:

* Clean folder structure
* Environment config
* Logging & error handling
* Unit tests
* Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

---

## 🎯 Final Outcomes

By the end, you can:

* Design and build scalable REST APIs
* Handle authentication, authorization, caching
* Debug and optimize backend performance
* Deploy production-grade apps
* Crack backend + Node.js interviews confidently

Would you like me to make this into a **month-by-month (timeline-based plan)** — like “Month 1 → Learn this, build this”, etc., so you can follow it as a structured journey?
