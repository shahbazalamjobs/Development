Learn Faster with AI tips

Here’s a shorter, simpler version:

* **Learn as needed:** Focus on what you need now; skip advanced stuff early.
* **Use AI smartly:** Let AI teach, quiz, and test you — don’t just copy answers.
* **Practice debugging:** Learn to fix code; AI code often needs correction.
* **Read good code:** Study GitHub projects to see how clean code looks.
* **Build useful tools:** Make small projects that solve your real problems.
* **Keep going:** Learning takes time — stay consistent and learn every day.
